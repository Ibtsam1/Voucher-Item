# Voucher-Item
Now, I add three new file name as 'Voucher.py', 'voucheritem.py' and 'main.py' in which two files 'voucher.py' and 'voucheritem.py' contain classes and third file 'main.py can import classes from that files. Also I add two more functions add and remove for removing/adding voucheritems.
